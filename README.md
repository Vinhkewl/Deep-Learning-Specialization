# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Credits

This repository contains my work for this specialization, currently i finished with the first course. The code base and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.
